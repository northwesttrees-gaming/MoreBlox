## About
MoreBlox is a old Minecraft modification that I started a long time ago that would store resources and show how much resources are in the block's inventory based on how many slots are used. This was for 1.0 of the mod. Recently I have started working on 2.0 which takes this a step further and gets the capacity of the slots for the resource and calculates the amount of slots used, new resources and textures and tool are being added, as well as some more advanced mechanics and better support for other mods to use the features in the modification.

## Supported Build
When 2.0 is release I will be dropping support for 1.0, I don't have the workspace for 1.0 which is partly why I am making a new version of the modification.

## 2.0 Features
- Some Resource Stockpiles (More is added each update)
- New resources and tools
- Resource stockpiles all have three models to display how full they are modeled by hand by me.

## 2.0 Longterm Plans
- New resources
- More stockpiles for blocks, items and tools.
- As much cross-mod support as I can add.
- A transport system of some kind.
